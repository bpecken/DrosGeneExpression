# Assessing tissue specificity of gene expression across <i>Drosophila</i> species

I assessed tissue specificity, as measured by Tau, of gene expression across reproductive and non-reproductive tissues among 9 <i>Drosophila</i> species. I used transcriptome data from Yang et al. 2018 (cited in full below).

## Data

The data included transcriptome data for 2 lines of <i>D. melanogaster</i> and 8 additional <i>Drosophila</i> species. Samples for each species include whole organism, head, thorax without digestive system, abdomen without digestive or reproductive system, gonad (female and male), reproductive system (female and male) without gonad or genitalia, genitalia (female or male), and digestive plus excretory system. For non-melanogaster species, genitalia were included in the reproductive system without gonad.

## Scripts

Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.3.1. Code was adapted from work by Matt Gibson and Meng Wu.
